p2pservice
=======

An Android application that runs a P2P background service.  It depends on
p2p4android which is a wrapper for p2p4java on Android platforms.
It was started as an example application for p2p4android. Compatible with

To use this for development:

	* get the additional libraries required and put them in the /lib folder.  There is a README file there with more information.
	* then you should be compiling the project without errors
